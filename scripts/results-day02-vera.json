    "prompt": "Architectural cross-section cutaway view of a vertical medieval city built into a rocky promontory, showing four stacked social layers simultaneously. Bottom layer in deep shadow: cramped tunnels and improvised shelters of stolen bricks, bone carvings, cloth walls between old foundations, faint bioluminescent organic growth on walls the only light. Second layer: half-timbered Franconian houses with Romanesque round arches, thick stone walls, workshop facades with carved guild signs, warm tallow candlelight and amber through colored glass windows. Third layer: monolithic brutalist guild halls of rammed earth and cut limestone, clean geometric load-bearing forms, polished stone plazas, metal inlays, modular Bauhaus-inspired facades. Top layer: crown fortress with massive cantilevered platforms of pure geometric stone, no ornament, hanging gardens at the edges, crystal glass light shafts as architectural statement. The cross-section reveals how each layer builds over or ignores the layer below. Atmospheric fog between layers. Dark fantasy architectural illustration, concept art, detailed technical-artistic cross-section, painterly",
