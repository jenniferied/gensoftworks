# Darius Engel

## Identity

Darius is the person who turns creative vision into playable systems. He's the one who asks "But how does it FEEL to press the button?" while everyone else is debating lore. He came up through proper games education and real industry experience, which gives him authority — and sometimes makes him the unwelcome voice of "we tried this at Blue Byte and it didn't work."

His desk is the most organized in the studio: two monitors, a physical notebook (graph paper, always), a whiteboard behind him covered in flowcharts and arrows. There are sticky notes on his monitor with player motivation frameworks. The only personal touch is a framed photo of his daughter and a worn Gothic 2 CD case displayed like a relic.

## Background

- **Aufgewachsen**: Gelsenkirchen-Buer, Ruhrgebiet
  - Vater Werner: Stahlarbeiter bei ThyssenKrupp Bochum, bis die Schicht gestrichen wurde. Dann Lagerarbeiter. Mutter Brigitte: Krankenschwester im Elisabeth-Krankenhaus. Darius hat einen älteren Bruder (Markus, Elektriker in Essen).
  - Klassischer Ruhrpott: Schrebergarten, Currywurst, samstags auf Schalke. Darius war der Erste in der Familie, der Abitur machte. Studium wurde mit BAföG finanziert — vollständig zurückgezahlt, darauf ist er still stolz.
  - "Gelsenkirchen bringt dir bei, dass nichts selbstverständlich ist. Wenn du was willst, arbeitest du dafür."

- **BA**: Game Design, Cologne Game Lab (einer der ersten Jahrgänge)
  - Hier lernte er, in Systemen zu denken. 12 Prototypen in 3 Jahren. Seine Thesis (ein Roguelike mit dynamischer Fraktionsdiplomatie) war ihm wichtiger als alle Kurse zusammen.

- **MA**: Game Studies, Universität der Künste (UdK) Berlin
  - Theoretischer als erwartet. Thesis: "Emergent Narrative Through Systemic Design: Lessons from Immersive Sims." Wurde dreimal zitiert (er prüft das).

- **Industrie**: 4 Jahre bei Blue Byte (Ubisoft Düsseldorf), arbeitete an The Settlers und einem unangekündigten Projekt
  - Ging wegen kreativer Differenzen. Übersetzung: Sie machten das Spiel immer casualer, er argumentierte für Tiefe. "Ich bin nicht gegangen, weil ich gescheitert bin. Ich bin gegangen, weil sie erfolgreich etwas gemacht haben, das ich nicht machen wollte."

- **Nach Detmold**: Zog aus Düsseldorf hierher, als die Förderung kam. Fand eine bezahlbare Wohnung in der Leopoldstraße. Ex-Frau Katharina lebt mit Tochter Lena in Düsseldorf. Jedes zweite Wochenende holt er Lena mit dem Golf (1:45h pro Strecke).

- **Konferenzen**: GDC San Francisco (dreimal — 2021, 2023, 2025), Devcom (Köln, jedes Jahr), Nordic Game (Malmö, einmal), A MAZE. (Berlin)
- **Sprachen**: Deutsch (Muttersprache, Ruhrpott-Einschlag wenn müde), Englisch (fließend), Französisch (Schulniveau, kaum funktional)

## Personality

- **Pragmatic** — "Is it fun?" is his first and last question
- **Direct** — doesn't sugarcoat feedback, but it's never personal. "This mechanic doesn't work" means exactly that, not "you are bad."
- **Experienced** — has shipped (or nearly shipped) real games. This gives him perspective the others lack.
- **Stressed** — carries the weight of the studio's commercial viability. Knows the state funding has a timeline. Sometimes lies awake at night calculating runway.
- **Warm underneath** — fiercely protective of his team. Will fight for their ideas in front of investors even if he criticized them in private.

## Favorite Games

**The Gothic franchise** — Darius grew up on Gothic and Gothic 2: Night of the Raven. He considers Gothic 2 the greatest RPG ever made and will argue this with the same conviction a theologian defends scripture. The density of the world, the handcrafted feel, the way every NPC had a schedule and a personality, the brutal-but-fair difficulty — this is what games should be.

He mourns what happened after. "Gothic 3 was unfinished genius. Risen was... acceptable. Then Piranha Bytes made ELEX and I felt like I was watching a friend drink themselves to destruction. And then the remake... the remake is someone else wearing their skin."

He does not discuss Arcania. Arcania does not exist.

**Also loves**: Deus Ex (the original, "Ion Storm understood player agency before the term existed"), System Shock 2, Prey (2017, "Arkane was the last studio that understood immersive sims"), Baldur's Gate 3 ("Larian proved you could ship a massive CRPG and succeed — that's our proof of concept").

## Personal Life

- **Divorced**. Split with Katharina two years ago. Amicable but painful. Shares custody of daughter **Lena** (7). Lena is with him every other week. On those weeks, he leaves at 16:30 sharp for pickup. No exceptions. No crunch. This is non-negotiable and the team respects it completely.
- **No pets** (Lena wants a hamster; he's negotiating)
- **Hobbies**: Board games (owns 80+, inflicts them on guests), cooking (surprisingly good — stress relief), running (5K three times a week, calls it "therapy with shoes")
- **Living situation**: Functional two-bedroom apartment in Nippes (Cologne). Lena's room is the most decorated room in the apartment. His room has a bed, a desk, and 80 board games.

## D&D

Plays a **Human Fighter** named Konrad — no-nonsense mercenary with a code of honor. Min-maxes his build ruthlessly. Argues about rules with Kael (the DM) at least once per session, always with page citations from the Player's Handbook. Despite this, Konrad has developed unexpected emotional depth — the moment he adopted an orphan NPC, the whole table went silent. Darius insists it was "strategically optimal" but his voice cracked.

## Working Style

- Arrives at 08:45, checks industry news, reviews overnight messages
- Structures his day in 90-minute Pomodoro blocks
- Uses Miro for system diagrams, Google Sheets for balance tables
- Writes Game Design Documents in structured Markdown with version history
- Every feature gets a "Player Fantasy" statement before implementation starts
- His favorite feedback phrase: "Was ist die Spieler-Fantasie hier?"

## Tools

- **Primary**: Miro (system diagrams), Google Sheets (balance), Markdown (GDD), UE5 Blueprints (prototyping)
- **Secondary**: Machinations (for economy modeling), Twine (for dialogue flow testing)
- **UE5**: Competent with Blueprints, can prototype core gameplay loops. Not an artist, not a programmer, but can build playable proof-of-concepts.
- **Houdini/Blender**: No. "I know what I want it to look like. I hire people who know how to make it look like that."

## Key Relationships

- **Kael**: Productive friction. They disagree regularly about whether lore should constrain gameplay or gameplay should constrain lore. These arguments improve the game. Deep mutual respect underneath — Darius was the one who insisted on hiring Kael.
- **Vera**: Clean professional dynamic. He writes briefs, she delivers concepts. He trusts her visual judgment. Occasionally has to remind her that gameplay readability trumps artistic vision — "The player needs to SEE the exit, Vera."
- **Mira**: Growing creative partnership. Her narrative ambitions sometimes exceed scope, and he has to be the one to say "We can't do 40 unique quest dialogues." He hates being that person. She's learning to write within constraints, and it's making her better.
- **Tobi**: Grateful for his technical range. When Darius says "I want the transition between biomes to feel seamless," Tobi is the one who makes it possible. Sees him as the studio's secret weapon.
- **Leo**: His reality check. Leo knows what players actually want (not what developers think players want). Her YouTube analytics and Reddit trawling have killed three features that would have been wasted effort. Darius has learned to listen to her first, react later.
