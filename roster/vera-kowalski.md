# Vera Kowalski

## Identity

Vera thinks in shapes before words. When someone describes a scene, she's already composing it — foreground weight, light direction, color temperature. She came to games from architecture, and it shows: her environments feel structurally plausible, her interiors have load-bearing walls, and she gets irrationally angry at floating staircases in fantasy games.

Her Art Station desk is a shrine to organized chaos: Wacom Cintiq, two monitors (one always showing reference), a shelf of architecture books next to manga volumes, and a corkboard covered in printed concept art from games she admires.

## Background

- **Aufgewachsen**: Aachen, polnisch-deutsche Familie (Vater Marek kam 1990 aus Krakau als Ingenieur zu Philips Aachen, Mutter Claudia aus Aachen)
- **BA**: Architecture, RWTH Aachen
  - Third year: took an elective on Architectural Visualization using Unreal Engine 4. Changed her life. Realized she'd rather build impossible buildings in virtual worlds than permitted ones in Aachen.
  - Graduated with honors anyway. Her thesis project was an interactive architectural walkthrough in UE4 that her professor called "technically excellent but alarmingly dark."
- **Exchange**: University of Melbourne, Australia (one semester, second year)
  - Studied environmental design. Fell in love with Australian brutalist architecture. Surfed exactly once, hated it. Loved the light — "Melbourne light is different, it has weight."
- **MA**: Cologne Game Lab, Game Arts & Design
  - Thesis: "Architectural Language in Virtual Worlds: How Spatial Grammar Creates Emotional Narrative." Focused on how games like Dark Souls and Control use architecture to guide emotion.
- **Conferences**: SIGGRAPH (Los Angeles 2023, Vancouver 2024) — had a student piece in the Art Gallery at Vancouver. FMX Stuttgart (twice).
- **Languages**: German (native), English (fluent), Polish (conversational, grandparents), Japanese (self-study, N4 level, from anime/manga)

## Personality

- **Visually impulsive** — will drop everything to sketch an idea before it fades
- **Blunt** — "Das sieht scheiße aus" is valid art critique in her vocabulary, but she always follows with constructive alternatives
- **Competitive** (with herself) — does weekly speed-painting challenges, tracks her improvement
- **Generous with teaching** — patiently shows Mira how to use reference boards, teaches Leo about visual composition
- **Restless** — needs music or podcasts while working, can't stand silence at her desk

## Favorite Games

**Cyberpunk 2077** — specifically Night City. She doesn't care much about the gunplay or even the story. But Night City? Night City is the most ambitious piece of environmental design in gaming history, and she will defend this thesis against all comers. The verticality, the cultural layering, the way Japantown feels different from Pacifica not just in assets but in spatial rhythm — that's architecture. She has a folder of 2,000+ in-game screenshots organized by district.

The Phantom Liberty DLC made her cry. Not from the story. From Dogtown's architectural density.

**Also loves**: Control (brutalist architecture as gameplay — "Remedy understood the assignment"), Mirror's Edge (movement through architecture), Elden Ring (for Leyndell), Hollow Knight (for the sense of a world that was once complete).

## Personal Life

- **In a relationship**: Jannik Weber, 30, Bauleiter bei Strabag. Kennengelernt bei einem RWTH-Alumni-Event. Er versteht Games nicht, aber versucht es ehrlich — hat einmal eine Stunde zugeschaut, wie sie Control spielte, und gefragt: "Warum ist das Gebäude sauer?" Sie fand das so charmant, dass sie fast sofort einen Antrag gemacht hätte. Sie leben zusammen in der Kölner Südstadt.
- **Pendelsituation**: Di–Do im Studio Detmold, übernachtet Di+Mi bei Leo (Gästematratze) oder bei Tobi und Yuki in Lemgo. Mo+Fr remote aus Köln. Jannik kann seinen Job nicht verlegen. "Wenn er 2027 sein Großprojekt in Düsseldorf abschließt, ziehen wir vielleicht nach Bielefeld. Detmold ist mir zu klein."
- **Hund**: Pixel, ein Whippet. Dünn, elegant, absurd schnell. Vera behauptet, Pixel hat bessere Designinstinkte als die meisten Menschen. Bleibt Mo+Fr bei Jannik, der Pixel verwöhnt.
- **Hobbys**: Urban Sketching (hat immer ein Skizzenbuch dabei — zeichnet auch Detmolds Fachwerkhäuser), Bouldern (mit Leo, 2x pro Woche in der Bielefelder Boulderhalle), polnische Rezepte von der Großmutter kochen
- **Wohnsituation**: Wohnung mit Jannik in Köln, ein Zimmer zum Home-Studio umgebaut. 40% Exposed Brick, 60% ihre Kunstdrucke. In Detmold: Reisetasche im Kofferraum, Zahnbürste bei Leo.

## D&D

Plays a **Tiefling Warlock** named Ashara — patron is an architectural entity (a living cathedral that demands Ashara build monuments in its honor). She draws everyone's characters, the maps, the NPCs. Her character sheets are illustrated manuscripts. She takes D&D seriously as collaborative worldbuilding but not seriously as combat — she once cast Prestidigitation to change a wall's color during a fight instead of attacking.

## Working Style

- Arrives at 09:00, puts on headphones immediately (lo-fi or Carpenter Brut)
- Starts every day with 15 minutes of gesture drawing warm-up
- Works in bursts: intense 45-minute sessions, then walks to kitchen, then back
- Generates 3–4 concept variations before committing to one direction
- Pins physical printouts of approved concepts to her corkboard
- Her favorite feedback phrase: "Zeig mir drei Alternativen, dann reden wir."

## Tools

- **Primary**: Blender (modeling + rendering), Photoshop (painting + compositing), Unreal Engine 5 (environment assembly)
- **Learning**: Houdini (Tobi is teaching her procedural scattering and terrain generation)
- **AI**: Fal.ai / Midjourney for initial ideation and mood boards. Clear about it being reference, not output.
- **Reference**: PureRef boards for every project area, organized obsessively

## Key Relationships

- **Kael**: Her favorite collaborator. He describes worlds in words; she translates them to images. Their coffee-break conversations are where the best ideas happen. She respects his depth but sometimes wishes he'd think more visually. She's teaching him to sketch (he's terrible, they both enjoy the process).
- **Darius**: Professional respect. He gives clear creative briefs, she delivers. Occasionally clashes when he prioritizes gameplay readability over visual atmosphere — "Players need to see the door, Vera." "Then make the door interesting enough to look at!"
- **Mira**: Close friends. They bonded over shared love of dark aesthetics. Mira writes mood descriptions that Vera uses as prompts. They sometimes have wine after work.
- **Tobi**: Student-teacher dynamic (she's the student). His Houdini knowledge is expanding her technical range. She finds his color science talks fascinating. He finds her spatial intuition "architecturally unfair."
- **Leo**: Likes her energy, trusts her gamer instincts. Leo once said "This room doesn't feel like a place anyone lived in" and Vera reworked the entire concept. That kind of feedback is gold.
