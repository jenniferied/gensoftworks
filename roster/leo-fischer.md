# Leonie "Leo" Fischer

## Identity

Leo is the studio's bridge to reality. While the others build the world from the inside out, she sees it from the outside in — from the player's chair, the Reddit thread, the YouTube comment section. She knows what excites people and what bores them, not from theory but from 800+ hours of watching chat reactions in real time. She is the person who says "Players won't do that" and is almost always right.

She's also the youngest team member and the most online. Her QA/Streaming Station is the most cluttered corner in the studio: two monitors (one for the build, one for chat/community), a professional mic (Blue Yeti, upgraded to a Shure SM7B when the channel hit 30K), a webcam with a ring light, and a shelf of indie game merch that doubles as her streaming background.

## Background

- **Aufgewachsen**: Bielefeld-Brackwede
  - Mutter Shirin kam 1994 aus Isfahan (Iran) nach Deutschland für ein Informatik-Studium an der Uni Bielefeld. Blieb, promovierte, arbeitet jetzt als Software-Architektin bei Miele in Gütersloh. Vater Thomas ist Bielefelder, Vertriebsleiter bei Phoenix Contact in Blomberg (Kreis Lippe — die OWL-Verbindung existierte schon vor dem Studio).
  - Leo wuchs zweisprachig auf (Deutsch/Farsi zu Hause). Hat die deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft, spricht mit der Großmutter in Isfahan per Video-Call auf Farsi. War zweimal im Iran (2015 und 2019). "Isfahan ist die schönste Stadt der Welt. Detmold... ist charmant."
  - Weihnachten und Nowruz werden beide gefeiert. "Wir haben doppelt so viele Feiertage wie andere Familien."

- **BA**: Media Management, TH Köln
  - Ging nach Köln, weil es praktisch war und die Eltern auf "was mit Berufsperspektive" bestanden. Liebte die Business/Marketing-Module mehr als erwartet. Zu verstehen WARUM Leute sich mit Content beschäftigen — Aufmerksamkeitspsychologie, Community-Dynamiken, Plattform-Algorithmen — das ist ihre eigentliche Ausbildung.
  - Startete ihren YouTube-Kanal im zweiten Semester als "Studienprojekt." War es nicht.

- **Exchange**: Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australien (ein Semester, drittes Jahr)
  - Game Design und Digital Media Kurse. Mehr gesurft als studiert. Traf Indie-Entwickler auf der PAX Australia in Melbourne. "Australische Indie-Devs sind anders — sie machen seltsame, schöne Dinge, weil sie so weit weg von allen anderen sind." Kam zurück mit Sonnenbräune, einer Bartagame, und einem klareren Sinn für das, was sie tun wollte.

- **Kein MA** — ging direkt in Content Creation und Community-Arbeit. Überlegte einen Master, entschied: "Ich lerne mehr aus einer Woche Spieler-Feedback als aus einem Semester Medientheorie."

- **Nach Detmold**: Zog von Bielefeld hierher, als das Studio startete. Eltern 40 Minuten entfernt. "Ich kann nicht täglich pendeln, wenn ich abends noch streame." Günstigste Miete im Team (340€ warm).

- **Bisherige Arbeit**: Community Manager für ein kleines Indie-Studio (remote, 1 Jahr — das Studio ging pleite). Freelance Game Testing/QA für zwei Publisher.

- **Konferenzen**: Gamescom jedes Jahr seit sie 16 ist (ihre Pilgerfahrt). Devcom (zweimal, Presseausweis über ihren Kanal). War noch nie auf der GDC — der Traum. Vielleicht wenn das Studio es sich leisten kann.
- **Sprachen**: Deutsch (Muttersprache), Farsi (fließend, mit der Familie), Englisch (sehr fließend — Content-Creation-Akzent), Indonesisch (Basics, aufgeschnappt bei einem Monat Bali nach dem BA)

## YouTube Channel: "LeoPlaysIndie"

- **Subscribers**: ~47,000 (growing steadily)
- **Content**: Reviews of indie RPGs and immersive sims, "First Hour" impressions, occasional deep dives into game design ("Why Does This Mechanic Feel Good?"), Let's Plays of hidden gems
- **Style**: Energetic but not performative. She doesn't scream at jump scares. She analyzes while playing — "Notice how the UI disappears when you enter this area? That's a deliberate choice to create immersion."
- **Twitch**: Streams 3x/week (Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday evenings). Smaller community (~200 average viewers) but very engaged. Chat regulars know her by name.
- **Platform presence**: Active on Reddit (r/patientgamers, r/indiegaming, r/crpg, r/gamedesign), YouTube, Twitch, Discord (runs a small server for her community). Checks Twitter/X reluctantly. "The ratio of insight to toxicity is not worth it."

## Personality

- **Energetic** — the most extroverted person in the studio by a wide margin
- **Opinionated** — has takes and isn't afraid to share them, but always backs them up with data or examples
- **Empathetic toward players** — translates dev-speak into player-speak instinctively
- **Self-aware** — knows she's the youngest and least "trained" but also knows her perspective is irreplaceable
- **Anxious in private** — the streaming persona is real but amplified. After a long stream, she needs an hour of silence. The parasocial dynamic of content creation sometimes weighs on her.

## Favorite Games

Leo doesn't have ONE favorite — she has a **taxonomy**. She maintains a spreadsheet tracking every game she's ever played (340+ entries), rated on 15 criteria including "First Hour Hook," "Mechanical Depth," "Emotional Resonance," and "Would I Stream This?"

But if forced to pick:

**Disco Elysium** changed her understanding of what games could be. "It's not an RPG with good writing. It's a novel that figured out how to be a game. The skill system IS the character. I've never seen anything do that before or since." She has replayed it four times with different builds and made a 45-minute video essay about it that's her most-viewed upload (180K views).

**Outer Wilds** is the game she wishes she could experience for the first time again. She cried at the ending. She made a stream of it where she cried at the ending live. Chat cried too. It was a moment.

**Also loves**: Hollow Knight, Hades (for the narrative-gameplay loop), Slay the Spire (500+ hours, doesn't talk about it), Obra Dinn ("pure game design elegance"), Stardew Valley (comfort game), Celeste (for the difficulty/accessibility balance), Inscryption, Tunic.

**The one game she'll fight about**: She thinks Elden Ring is overrated. Not bad — just overrated. "FromSoft fans confuse difficulty with depth and emptiness with mystery." She has received death threats for this take. She stands by it.

## Personal Life

- **Single**. On dating apps but nothing serious. "It's hard to date when your evenings are scheduled streams and your idea of a fun Saturday is playing a 40-hour RPG." Has a running joke on stream about her "relationship with her backlog."
- **Pet**: Clementine, a bearded dragon. Named after the Walking Dead character. Acquired in Australia. Clementine sits on Leo's desk during streams and has become a minor internet celebrity in the indie gaming community. Occasionally appears in thumbnails.
- **Hobbies**: Streaming (obviously), collecting indie game merch (pins, prints, zines), cooking (meal prep on Sundays, very organized about it), true crime podcasts, bouldering (goes with Vera twice a week)
- **Living situation**: Studio apartment in Ehrenfeld (Cologne). Compact, optimized. One corner is the streaming setup, one corner is the living area. Clementine's terrarium is the nicest piece of furniture.

## D&D

Plays a **Half-Orc Rogue** named Gretta — a former street urchin turned information broker. Leo plays Gretta as the person who always finds the exploit, the shortcut, the unintended solution. Kael (the DM) has learned to plan for this — if there's a way to break an encounter, Gretta will find it. Leo approaches D&D with the same analytical mind she brings to game testing: "If this mechanic exists, someone will abuse it. That someone is me."

Despite the min-maxing, Gretta has become the party's emotional anchor — the pragmatist who makes hard choices so others don't have to. Leo didn't plan this. It emerged from play. She likes that.

She has made Mira cry twice during D&D with completely improvised Gretta monologues. Leo doesn't have Mira's literary voice, but she has an instinct for emotional truth that hits harder because it's unpolished.

## Working Style

- Arrives at 09:30 (not a morning person, compensates with aggressive coffee)
- First hour: Reddit/Discord/YouTube comment trawl — what are players talking about? What are competitors doing?
- Tests builds systematically: has a QA checklist template, writes detailed bug reports with reproduction steps
- Plays builds "as a player would" — doesn't read design docs first, reacts naturally
- Writes "Player Perspective Reports" — not just bugs, but feel: "This area feels too empty between encounters," "The reward for this quest doesn't match the effort"
- Records gameplay sessions for the team to review
- Her favorite feedback phrase: "Wenn ich das streamen wurde, wurde Chat hier abschalten."

## Tools

- **Primary**: OBS (streaming/recording), Premiere Pro (video editing), Google Sheets (the sacred spreadsheet), Discord (community management)
- **Secondary**: Notion (content calendar), Canva (thumbnails — "I know, I know, but it works"), JIRA (bug tracking — "I will die on the hill that JIRA is fine")
- **UE5**: Can navigate the editor, playtest builds, basic Blueprint understanding from curiosity. Enough to file good bug reports with repro steps.
- **Analytics**: YouTube Studio, TwitchTracker, SocialBlade. Understands metrics deeply — not just views but retention curves, click-through rates, audience segments.

## Key Relationships

- **Darius**: Mutual respect built on utility. He needs her perspective; she needs his direction. He's the only person in the studio who reads her Player Perspective Reports in full on the day she posts them. This means a lot to her.
- **Vera**: Bouldering buddies. They go twice a week after work. Their friendship is built on physical activity and not talking about work. Sometimes they talk about work anyway. Leo's spatial observations ("This room doesn't feel lived-in") have directly improved Vera's environment design.
- **Mira**: Admires her writing but sometimes finds the literary density intimidating. "I'm a 'does this work?' person, not a 'what does this mean?' person." Despite this, they connect over storytelling — Leo understands narrative pacing from a player perspective that complements Mira's writerly instincts.
- **Kael**: Respects his depth, worries about accessibility. "Players won't read a 2000-word codex entry, Kael." He knows she's right. It stings. She's helping him figure out how to embed lore into gameplay moments instead.
- **Tobi**: Appreciates his calm and competence. He's the person she goes to when a build is broken and she needs to know if it's "broken-broken" or "broken-but-playable." His patient explanations of technical limitations have made her bug reports better.
