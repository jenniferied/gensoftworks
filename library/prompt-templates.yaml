      Imagine a full-body character portrait for a dark fantasy worldbuilding
      bible. {description}
      Show the complete figure from head to feet, standing on the ground,
      against a clean white background — like a concept art character sheet.
      Think Skyrim or Kingdom Come: Deliverance — grounded in historical
      reality, not high fantasy.
      Ground rules: full body visible, no cropping at waist or knees. No
      anime influence, no fantasy clichés, no glowing effects. Everything
      should look weathered and real. Late medieval Europe, around 1300 CE.
      Serious and grounded. The image must contain no text, no labels, no
      titles, no captions, no watermarks whatsoever.

      Imagine a concept art illustration of a complete medieval weapon on a
      clean white background — like a page from a game artbook. {description}
      The entire weapon must be visible in the frame — from pommel to blade
      tip, nothing cropped. Flat on a white surface, viewed from above.
      The style should be high quality concept art — slightly painterly
      rendering with sharp detail, not a photograph and not a cartoon.
      Think Skyrim or Dark Souls official artbook.
      Ground rules: no fantasy ornamentation, no glowing runes, no magical
      effects. Historically plausible, around 1300 CE. The image must
      contain no text, no labels, no titles, no captions, no watermarks

      Imagine a sweeping establishing shot of a dark fantasy landscape.
      {description}
      This should feel like a matte painting for a cinematic opening —
      wide, atmospheric, immersive. Think Skyrim's environmental art meets
      The Witcher's moody lighting.
      Ground rules: overcast sky, volumetric fog, muted desaturated palette.
      No bright fantasy colors, no clean pristine surfaces. Everything shows
      age and weather. Medieval European, around 1300 CE. The image must

      Imagine a dark fantasy scene rooted in Germanic folklore. {description}
      The mood should be unsettling and ancient — like the original Brothers
      Grimm before they were sanitized. Horror through atmosphere, not gore.
      The supernatural should feel ambiguous and dangerous.
      Ground rules: this is concept art, not a book illustration. No paper
      texture, no drawn-on-parchment effect, no border or frame. Render as
      a photorealistic or painterly scene. No high fantasy aesthetics, no
      bright colors, no cute or friendly creatures. The image must contain
      no text, no labels, no titles, no captions, no watermarks whatsoever.

      Imagine a full-body character portrait for a dark fantasy worldbuilding
      bible. {description}
      Show the complete figure from head to feet, standing on the ground.
      The portrait should clearly communicate this person's social position
      through their clothing, posture, and equipment. Think of it as a
      character reference for a game like Kingdom Come: Deliverance — every
      detail of clothing tells you about their status and profession.
      Ground rules: full body visible, no cropping at waist or knees. No
      anime, no fantasy clichés, no glowing effects. Historically grounded,
      around 1300 CE. Serious and realistic. The image must contain no text,
      no labels, no titles, no captions, no watermarks whatsoever.

      [Background] A clean white studio background with soft, even lighting.
      No environmental elements — this is a full-body character reference.

      [Subject] {description}

      [Key Details] This must be a FULL BODY portrait showing the complete
      figure from head to feet — no cropping at the waist or knees. The
      character stands on the ground plane. The clothing and materials must
      be historically plausible for late medieval Central Europe (~1300 CE).
      Fabrics are wool, linen, leather — no synthetic-looking materials.
      Skin should show realistic texture: pores, weathering, scars, sun
      damage where appropriate.

      [Constraints] This is photorealistic dark fantasy concept art in the
      style of Skyrim and Kingdom Come: Deliverance. The palette must be
      muted and desaturated — no bright saturated colors. There must be
      NO anime influence, NO glowing magical effects, NO text or watermarks.
      The character must look like a real person who lives in a harsh
      medieval world, not a fantasy illustration.
    negative_prompt: null

      [Background] A clean white background with soft, even lighting.
      Game artbook layout — no distracting elements.

      [Subject] {description}

      [Key Details] The complete weapon must be shown from end to end,
      nothing cropped. Subtle material textures — steel patina, leather
      grain, wood aging. Every component historically plausible for ~1300
      CE European metallurgy.

      [Constraints] This is high quality concept art for a game artbook —
      slightly painterly rendering, NOT a photograph and NOT a cartoon.
      Think Skyrim or Dark Souls official artbook style. NO fantasy
      ornamentation — no gems, no glowing runes, no ornate filigree.
      Sharp detail, muted desaturated palette, 4K.
    negative_prompt: null

  locations:
    template: >
      [Background] An overcast sky with volumetric fog and atmospheric
      perspective creating depth. The horizon is visible. Natural lighting —
      no dramatic fantasy sky effects.

      [Subject] {description}

      [Key Details] Architecture (if present) must follow late medieval
      (~1300 CE) European construction: stone, timber, thatch, no concrete
      or modern materials. Vegetation is regionally appropriate — deciduous
      forests, marshland, alpine scrub. Everything shows age, weather damage,
      and organic growth. Moss on stone, lichen on wood, weeds in cracks.

      [Constraints] This is a cinematic establishing shot — wide composition,
      strong depth of field, matte-painting quality. The palette must be
      muted and desaturated, matching the region's color scheme. NO bright
      fantasy colors, NO pristine clean surfaces, NO modern elements. This
      is a world that looks like it smells of wet stone and woodsmoke.

      [Background] {description}

      [Atmosphere] This scene exists in the space between reality and
      folklore — the viewer should be uncertain whether what they see is
      supernatural or a trick of light and shadow. The horror comes from
      ambiguity, not from explicit monstrosity.

      [Key Details] Root this in Germanic folklore tradition — Grimm, not
      Tolkien. The supernatural elements should feel ancient, earthy, and
      dangerous. Use cold light sources (moonlight, bioluminescence, distant
      fire) for illumination. Shadows should be deep and concealing.

      [Constraints] NO high fantasy aesthetics — no glowing magic, no
      ethereal beauty, no clean supernatural beings. The folklore creatures
      of this world are unsettling because they are almost-real, because
      they exist at the edge of perception. Atmospheric horror through
      restraint. Painterly quality, dark palette, 4K detail.

      [Background] A clean white studio background with soft, even lighting
      for a full-body character reference.

      [Subject] {description}

      [Key Details] This must be a FULL BODY portrait showing the complete
      figure from head to feet — no cropping at the waist or knees. The
      character stands on the ground plane. The character's social class
      must be immediately readable from their clothing, posture, and
      equipment. A noble's garments are finer but still medieval. A
      peasant's clothing is rough and patched. An Order knight's armor
      bears their symbol but is functional, not decorative.

      [Constraints] This is photorealistic dark fantasy concept art. The
      character must look like a real person from ~1300 CE medieval Europe.
      NO anime influence, NO fantasy clichés, NO glowing effects, NO text.
      The palette is muted and desaturated. Clothing construction must be
      historically plausible — no zippers, no machine stitching, no modern
      cuts. Skyrim meets Kingdom Come: Deliverance meets The Witcher.
